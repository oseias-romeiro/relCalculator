# relCalculator
Calculator to find out the relations of sets like Reflexive, Symmetric and Antisymmetric properties. In addition to assembling the matrix representation of relations.

## What is relations? What are Reflexive, Symmetric and Antisymmetric properties?

Relation is a collection of ordered pairs. For each pair (x, y), each object X is from the symbols of the first set and the Y is from the symbols of the second set.

But a relation can be between one set with it too. In this case the X and Y objects are from symbols of only one set, this case is most common!

For matrixes representation of relations, each line represent the X object and column, Y object. Each square represents a combination based on symbols of the set. The squares are 1 if your pair exist on relation. But it depends of symbols set, maybe it can not use letters, instead numbers or whatever other set of symbols.
